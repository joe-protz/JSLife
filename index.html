      Conway's Game of Life is a visual representation of what is known as an
      automota. The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional
      orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible
      states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every
      cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
      horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time,
      the following transitions occur:
      <ul > 
        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live
      neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation. 
    </li>
    <li>Any live cell with two or three
      live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    </li>
    <li>Any live cell with more
      than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
    </li> 
    <li> Any dead cell
      with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by
      reproduction.
    </li>
    </ul>
